# VectorFields
VectorFields in this example were authored from
[this Houdini Indie Project](https://github.com/drichardson/HoudiniExamples/blob/master/vectorfields.hiplc)
following the instructions from Houdini's
[Game Tools | Vector Fields to UE4 page](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/exporting-vector-fields-to-ue4/).

# Nav Mesh Example
This example uses [ANavigationTestingActor](https://api.unrealengine.com/INT/API/Runtime/NavigationSystem/ANavigationTestingActor/index.html)
to visualize the paths actors would take.

This example also demonstrates the use of [ANavModifierVolume](https://api.unrealengine.com/INT/API/Runtime/NavigationSystem/ANavModifierVolume/), including the use of a custom
[UNavArea](https://api.unrealengine.com/INT/API/Runtime/NavigationSystem/NavAreas/UNavArea/index.html) sub-class
with a custom path cost.
